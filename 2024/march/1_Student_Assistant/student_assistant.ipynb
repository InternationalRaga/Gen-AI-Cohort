It is calculated using the formula:\n\n```\nArea = πr²\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n* π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159\n* r is the radius of the circle, which is the distance from the center to any point on the circle\n\n**Detailed Solution Summary**\n\nTo find the area of a circle:\n\n1. Measure or find the radius of the circle (r).\n2. Square the radius (r²).\n3. Multiply the squared radius by π.\n\n**Practical Examples**\n\n* **Example 1:** Find the area of a circle with a radius of 5 cm.\n\n```\nArea = πr² = 3.14159 * 5² = 78.5398 cm²\n```\n\n* **Example 2:** A pizza has a diameter of 12 inches. Find the area of the pizza.\n\nThe diameter is half the length of the circle, so the radius is 12/2 = 6 inches.\n\n```\nArea = πr² = 3.14159 * 6² = 113.0973 inches²\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Problem-Solving Methods**\n\n1. **Identify the Radius:** Measure or find the radius of the circle using a ruler, compass, or the given information.\n2. **Square the Radius:** Multiply the radius by itself to obtain r².\n3. **Multiply by π:** Multiply the squared radius by π to calculate the area.\n4. **State the Answer:** Express the area with the appropriate units (e.g., square centimeters, square inches).\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n* The area of a circle can also be expressed in terms of its diameter (d) using the formula:\n\n```\nArea = (1/4)πd²\n```\n* If the circumference of the circle is given (C), you can use the formula:\n\n```\nArea = (C²/4)π\n```\n* The area of a circle is always positive."

Python provides several methods to achieve this:\n\n**1. `+` Operator:**\n\nThe `+` operator directly concatenates two lists, creating a new list with the elements of both lists combined:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\nlist3 = list1 + list2\nprint(list3)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n**2. `extend()` Method:**\n\nThe `extend()` method appends the elements of one list to the end of another list, modifying the original list:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\nlist1.extend(list2)\nprint(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n**3. `list.append()` Method:**\n\nSimilar to `extend()`, the `append()` method appends a single element to the end of the list. However, you must append each element individually:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nfor element in [4, 5, 6]:\n    list1.append(element)\nprint(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n**Choosing the Right Method:**\n\n* Use the `+` operator for quick concatenation of two or more lists.\n* Use `extend()` to append the elements of one list to another without creating a new list.\n* Use `list.append()` if you need to append individual elements sequentially."
